Learning Rust through various projects

### Beginner: Simple Calculator

Description: Build a basic calculator that can handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Take user input, process the mathematical operation, and display the result.
Concepts to learn: Basic Rust syntax, variable declaration, user input/output, basic arithmetic operations.

### Beginner-Intermediate: To-Do List CLI Application

Description: Create a command-line application where users can add tasks, mark them as completed, delete them, and list all tasks. Store the tasks in a file so they persist between runs.
Concepts to learn: Structs, Enums, File I/O, Error Handling, command-line arguments.

### Intermediate: Text-Based Adventure Game

Description: Design a game where players navigate through rooms, pick up items, and solve puzzles. Players should have a health meter, and there should be enemies to combat.
Concepts to learn: More advanced Structs and Enums, Modules, Pattern Matching, Traits, Ownership, and Borrowing.

### Intermediate-Advanced: Simple HTTP Server

Description: Build a basic HTTP server that can serve static files and handle basic GET and POST requests.
Concepts to learn: Networking, Concurrency (Threads & async/await), Error Propagation, Parsing HTTP.

### Advanced: Real-Time Chat Application

Description: Create a chat application where users can join "rooms" and send messages in real-time. The application should consist of a server that manages different chat rooms and a client that users can run to join these rooms and chat.
Concepts to learn: WebSockets or other real-time communication protocols, more advanced networking, more advanced concurrency (e.g., message-passing), and perhaps even integrating with a database for storing chat history or user details.
