# To-Do List CLI Application

Welcome to the To-Do List CLI application project. This command-line tool allows users to manage their tasks efficiently.

## Overview

Using Rust, we've created a simple yet effective to-do list application that provides the functionality to add tasks, mark them as completed, delete them, and list all tasks. One of the key features of this application is that tasks are stored in a file, ensuring that they persist between runs.

This project gives insights into several Rust concepts such as Structs, Enums, File I/O, Error Handling, and command-line arguments.

## Commands

Here are the commands that the application supports:

1. **Adding a Task**
   ```
   cargo run -- add "Your Task Here"
   ```
   This command will add the specified task to your to-do list.

2. **Listing All Tasks**
   ```
   cargo run -- list
   ```
   This command will display all the tasks, both completed and pending.

3. **Marking a Task as Complete**
   ```
   cargo run -- complete TASK_NUMBER
   ```
   Replace `TASK_NUMBER` with the task's number that you want to mark as complete.

4. **Deleting a Task**
   ```
   cargo run -- delete TASK_NUMBER
   ```
   Replace `TASK_NUMBER` with the task's number that you want to delete.

5. **Help**
   ```
   cargo run -- help
   ```
   This command will display all available commands and their brief description.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Execute any of the above commands as per your requirement.
